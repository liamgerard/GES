This Excel Add-in has been designed to significantly enhance the functionality and user-experience when working with Excel spreadsheets. Its primary purpose is to streamline the process of manipulating cell properties and performing certain common tasks. It achieves this by providing easily accessible options to perform actions that would otherwise require navigating through multiple Excel menus or performing multiple mouse clicks.
Some of the notable features of this add-in include:
• Number Format Cycles: Multiple number formatting options are available, including general, currency, percentage, multiple, and binary formats, and all are completely customizable.
• Cell Formatting: This offers extensive options for cell formatting, including font size and color, fill color, and border styles.
• Cell Value and Formula Modification: These features allow users to easily increase or decrease a cell value by factors of 10, multiply by -1, add an IfError() wrap, convert formulas into their values, and clean formulas.
• Autocolor Cells: Users can auto-color cells based on the value or formula they contain, enhancing visual data representation and error checking.
• Row and Column Management: This provides users the convenience of sizing and autofitting rows or columns in their spreadsheet, horizontal and vertical alignment cycles, and indent control.
• Error Handling Capabilities: The add-in includes robust error handling to ensure a smooth user experience, alerting users of any issues in an easy-to-understand manner.
The add-in integrates seamlessly with Excel and has been designed to interact directly with the active spreadsheet window, allowing the user to perform these actions without losing focus on their current work.
